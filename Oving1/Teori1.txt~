Theory:
1. The histogram showing frequency of the intensity values of an image will
tell you if its low contrast if the frequent values are closely grouped, while
it also usually has lacks intensities in the higher and/or lower spectre of
the histogram. An example is the following picture:

2. Histogram equalization enhances the contrast to the image. Equalizing an
image a second time wont change the image further, as the intensities are
already amplified to whatever values they are supposed to be.

4. Correlation is the process of moving a filter mask over the image, as in
all spatail filtering, and computing the sum of products at each location. Convolution
has a simmilar mechanig, except that the filter is rotated 180 degrees. All
symmetrical kernels will have the samme effect for both convolution and
correlation. An example is [1,1,1] or [1,2,4,2,1]
